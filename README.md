# Warfare

A [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that provides an implementation of MCDM's warfare system as seen in [Strongholds & Followers](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/strongholds-followers). The module adds a special sheet for NPC Actors that designates them as a unit and allows you to input any units created with the warfare system.

This project is not affiliated with MCDM and is in no way endorsed by them.
